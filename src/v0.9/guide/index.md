# Orbit.js

Orbit is a composable framework for orchestrating change processing, tracking, 
and synchronization across multiple data sources.

Orbit is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and distributed
on npm through the [@orbit](https://www.npmjs.com/org/orbit) organization.
Pre-built distributions are provided in several module formats and ES language
levels. 

Orbit is isomorphic - it can be run both in modern browsers as well as in the 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime.

## Goals

Orbit was primarily designed as a data layer to support the needs of ambitious
client-side web applications, including:

* Optimistic and pessimistic UX patterns.

* Pluggable sources that share common interfaces, to allow similar behavior on
  different devices.

* Connection durability by queueing and retrying requests.

* Application durability by persisting all transient state.

* Warm caches of data available immediately on startup.

* Client-first / serverless development.

* Custom request coordination across multiple sources, allowing for priority
  and fallback plans.

* Branching and merging of immutable data caches.

* Deterministic change tracking.

* Undo / redo editing support.

In order to meet these goals, many primitives were developed in Orbit that can
be used in ways that go beyond these original use cases.

## Packages

### Core libraries

Orbit consists of the following core libraries:

* [@orbit/core](./packages/@orbit/core) - A core set of primitives for 
performing, tracking, and responding to asynchronous tasks, including:

  * An event system that allows listeners to engage with the fulfillment of 
    events by returning promises.

  * An asynchronous task processing queue.

  * A log that tracks a history of changes and allows for revision and 
    interrogation.

  * A bucket interface for persisting state. Used by logs and queues.

* [@orbit/data](./packages/@orbit/data) - Applies the core Orbit primitives
to data sources. Includes the following elements:

  * A schema for defining models, including attributes and relationships. 

  * Operations used to manipulate records (e.g. `addRecord`, `removeRecord`, 
    `addToHasMany`, etc.).

  * Transforms, which are composed of any number of operations, and must be
    performed transactionally.

  * A query language that allows query expressions to be composed in a flexible
    AST form.

  * A base `Source` class that can be used to abstract any source of data.
    Sources can be decorated as `pullable`, `pushable`, `queryable`, `syncable`, 
    and/or `updatable` - each decorator provides a unique interface that allows 
    for transforms and queries to be applied as appropriate.

* [@orbit/utils](./packages/@orbit/utils) - A common set of utility functions
used by Orbit libs.

### Standard data sources

Orbit provides the following sources for accessing and persisting data:

* [@orbit/jsonapi](./packages/@orbit/jsonapi) - Provides full CRUD support,
  including complex querying, for a RESTful API that conforms to the
  [JSON:API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification.

* [@orbit/local-storage](./packages/@orbit/local-storage) - 
  Persists records to local storage.

* [@orbit/indexeddb-bucket](./packages/@orbit/indexeddb-bucket) - 
  Persists records to IndexedDB.

These standard sources can provide guidance for building your own custom sources
as well.

### Standard persistence buckets

Buckets are used to persist application state, such as queued requests and 
change logs. Standard buckets include:

* [@orbit/local-storage-bucket](./packages/@orbit/local-storage-bucket) - 
  Persists state to local storage.

* [@orbit/indexeddb-bucket](./packages/@orbit/indexeddb-bucket) - 
  Persists state to IndexedDB.

## Contributing

Orbit's main packages are maintained in this "mono-repo" and managed by
[lerna](https://lernajs.io).

### Installation

Install dependencies for the main repo and its packages:

```
npm install
```

### Building

Build distributions for all packages:

```
npm run build
```

### Testing

Test all packages:

```
npm test
```

Or `cd` into each package's dir and test it individually in the browser:

```
cd packages/@orbit/core
testem
```
